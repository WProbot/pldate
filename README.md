# pldate
simple date-manipulation in Perl (to be used in shell scripts)

Might be useful on platforms (like AIX) that don't have GNU-dateutils.

It only handles dates, not times or timestamps,
so it has nothing to do with timezones and daylight-saving-times.

It's only supported date-format is YYYYMMDD
